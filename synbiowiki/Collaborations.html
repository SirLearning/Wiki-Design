                        <p>We are strongly aware of the significance of communication and cooperation on the development
                            and functioning of the project. It is also extensive and adequate communication that can
                            promote the progress and development of science. We always keep in contact and make
                            cooperation with other teams when expanding and implementing our pre-developed programs.
                            This year, iGEM HUST-China has cooperated in a diverse way with other iGEM teams. We have
                            organized and participated in events such as Central China Meetup, Yeast Meetup, etc., and
                            have built in-depth alliances with multiple teams. In addition, utilizing relevant project
                            experience and knowledge, we have provided a variety of help and guidance to some teams.</p>

                        <p>As the organizer, iGEM HUST-China assembled main enrolled iGEM teams in central China:
                            HUST-China, HUST2-China, WHU-China, HZAU-China, NUDT-China and CSU-China. After iGEM
                            HUST-China's proposal and joint discussions, all the teams have successfully reached a
                            long-term consensus of strong collaboration. During the development of the project in the
                            past six months, Central China Union as an exoteric platform, provided all participating
                            members with opportunities for communication &amp; cooperation in various aspects such as
                            discussion on experimental operation, collaboration on Education, consulting about Human
                            Practice, etc., promoting the shared development of iGEM teams in central China.</p>

                            treatment with less side effects and convenience. On the one hand, the engineering bacteria
                            have stronger ability to break down fatty acids, unblocking the pores, which will destroy
                            the anaerobic environment. On the other hand their engineering bacteria can secrete
                            bacteriocin which is able to kill acnes.</p>

                        <p>NWU-China-A project this year is the production of Tyrian Purple. Due to natural yield
                            little, difficulty in chemosynthesis and the potential pollution, its high yield production
                            hasn't been realized. Therefore, they plan implement a two-cell reaction by spatiotemporally
                            separating the two consecutive procedures of the production, so that the enzyme in tyrian
                            purple metabolic pathway could achieve its highest efficiency. Since our project also
                            relates to pigments, we quickly reached an agreement to collaborate after having an in-depth
                            understanding of each other's projects. We exchanged suggestions and experimental
                            experiences on intracellular expression to jointly promote the development of project. In

                            HUST-China team hosted 2021 iGEM Central China Meetup. The participating teams exchanged
                            their respective projects and put forward suggestions for improvement to each other, and
                            helped each other at many levels. In the end, all the teams also successfully reached a
                            consensus on long-term cooperation, formed a Central China Union, and worked closely in the
                            follow-up schedule.</p>

                            their knowledge about pichia pastoris including promoters that has been used and the pros
                            and cons of choosing it as the expression vector. They also raised some problems met or
                            conquered during experiments like the low expression of the yeast. Our team, along with
                            CPU-China presented our project and also communicated with each other about issues like
                            conditions to induce expression of yeast and measures to prevent bacteria contamination.</p>

                        <p>After two days of defence, discussion and voting, only 12 teams qualified for the award, and
                            HUST-China's Mr. Tony project won Active Participation Award in the event and the 3rd place
                            in the industrial circuit, and was well received by the students, teachers and judges.</p>

                            an offline meetup. We shared our project and make suggestion on project to each other. This
                            collaboration made us have a deeper thinking on our project and a further understanding
                            about the actual application of the project.</p>
                        <p>During the meetup, ZJU-China specially invited HiZJU-China and ZJUT-China to join this meetup
                            together. All teams have shared their ideas of project design. After meetup, members of
                            ZJU-China leaded us to visit their laboratory and invited us to have lunch together. In a
                            pleasant atmosphere, we have made communication in details about several perspectives such

                        <p>SynBio United aims to build an international synthetic biology community with the
                            headquarters of regional synthetic biology organizations, providing a platform for these
                            organizations to communicate and help them find common goals. HUST-China was actively
                            involved in SynBio United, interacting with synthetic biology scholars and organizations
                            around the world to identify regional challenges, and to explore what things should be done
                            to overcome difficulties and embrace the future of synthetic biology together.</p>
