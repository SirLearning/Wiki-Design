                            contributions beneficial to the world, and strive to be responsible for people around the
                            world. It means that at the end of completion of the project, it is important to broaden the
                            impact of the project on society and humanity. This is not only instructive to the long-term
                            development of our project and contribution to society, but also useful to the spread of
                            science in the whole society with our own strength.</p>
                        <p>We tend to change the society's attitude towards hair dyeing and perming via organizing Brave
                            Color Challenge in worldwide. And the widespread of our experience and knowledge is deepened
                            through education in all age. At the same time, our team give out our own strength through
                            social volunteering. Additionally, we develop our product into a complete business plan
                            which software and hardware are included. We also shared our software design on the internet
                            via open source.</p>

                            and found that the domestic people may have a certain degree of bias on the style of the
                            exaggerated permed or dyed hair. Therefore, we designed a reversible bio-perm dyeing system
                            that fades instantly, and selected plant dyes to mitigate its harm to health and
                            environment. However, during project surveys and field visits, we found that while most
                            people were interested in Mr. Tony's products with some trust and expectation, the
                            designated product didn't actually eliminate people's biases.</p>
                        <p>We looked up the relevant information comprehensively and found that prejudice is essentially
                            a negative understanding and attitude to people and things that bulit up from objective
                            facts, just like stereotypes. Prejudice is not easy to be eliminated in a short period of
                            time, and it often requires years of subtle influence to do so. But we wouldn't give up just
                            because it's time-consuming, and HUST-China decided to do its best to do its part in the
                            field of perming and dyeing to eliminate prejudice.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we also found that the most terrible prejudice is often the prejudice against
                            themselves. Long-term Influenced under growth and living environment, many people become
                            suspicious of themselves after being prejudiced by others. Susan Bealey, M.D. of the
                            University of British Columbia in Canada and health coach, says it's not uncommon, or even
                            quite normal, for perfect and capable people to think they can't. These "no" misconceptions
                            are biases that are embedded by others, often from families where people grew up, and may be
                            judged from a conservative perspective by family members. And the elimination of this
                            prejudice often rely on self-contained self-confidence and a strong heart, telling
                            themselves to be brave and not care about what others think. It is in this way that
                            HUST-China launched the Brave Color Challenge around the world, calling on people to
                            eliminate prejudice and be brave enough to be themselves.</p>
                        <p>The slogan of Brave Color Challenge is to be brave to find the own self, and draws on the
                            relay model of the Ice Bucket Challenge to expand the project's impact. We allow challengers
                            to change their hair color via Photoshop, eliminating challengers' concerns about hair
                            health and social attitudes, skipping tedious thoughts and selection processes, and just
                            appreciating their hairstyle after dyeing their hair. We not only provided hair color advice
                            for the challenger, more importantly, we aimed to let the challenger find a more beautiful
                            self, and encourage them to be brave take steps to embrace their own identity. After the
                            challenge, many challengers told us that they did challenge themselves and found
                            self-confidence. HUST-China is proud to contribute to the elimination of self-prejudice.</p>
                        <p>In addition, we have made the benefits of natural dyes widely understood to challengers and
                            the public through knowledge cards in the hope of enhancing public understanding of this
                            potentially large but low market share industry.</p>

                                                a number of challengers, who said that they did have some bias and
                                                trouble about hair dyeing. Through this challenge, they found their
                                                adoring hair dye color, and they would also try to use less harmful
                                                natural perm and dye to explore their more beautiful image. After we

                        <p>Education and public outreach are important guidelines for our team. In the past year, we
                            have carried out a series of educational practices mainly aimed at students. In the process
                            of communicating with many schools and institutions, we took the advantages of university
                            platform, and conveyed the team's name and knowledge about synthetic biology to a wider
                            audience. Our audience mainly includes pupils, secondary school students, college students
                            and those who love life science. Our educational activities not only include traditional
                            offline knowledge lectures, communication meetings and road shows, but also offer courses in
                            popular online media, providing online education resources for public, which is a highlight
                            for our team.</p>

                        <p>We always believe that the spread of science will not be limited by age. As the first stop of
                            our education program, we came to the Primary School affiliated to Huazhong University of
                            Science and Technology. Together with other scientific research teams and individuals of
                            Huazhong University of Science and Technology, we have carried out a series of interesting
                            science courses called "Dream Class" in the hope that pupils can establish their dreams in
                            class. In this course, we designed an interesting biology Mini Game to tell the children
                            about the basic and interesting biology knowledge, and also introduced the past projects of
                            the HUST-China team to the children in popular language. Unexpectedly, the pupils not only
                            understood the story, but also made wild suggestions to our project.</p>

                                                Mini Game, let the children imperceptibly understand the double helix
                                                structure of DNA, which laid the foundation for the later interest
                                                development. Then, on the basis of video, we explained the structure of
                                                DNA and other basic and interesting biological knowledge to primary
                                                school students in an easy-to-understand language, hoping to increase
                                                their interest in biology. Next, we tried to tell stories about the past
                                                projects of the HUST-China team, and used the project as an example to
                                                give them a more concrete understanding of what synthetic biology can
                                                do. Although it was a little difficult, the children listened to the
                                                whole project very carefully and unexpectedly understood most of it. In
                                                the final communication session, the pupils not only asked questions,

                                                lectures for students from two middle schools in Central China. Most of
                                                the students who participated in the lectures have knowledge backgrounds
                                                in life science competitions, so in the presentation, we focus on
                                                broadening the knowledge of students . In the lecture, we popularized
                                                the basic concepts of synthetic biology, and from the perspective of
                                                practical application, we led the students to further understand the
                                                knowledge of molecular biology, biochemistry and metabolomics. In the
                                                lecture, we briefly talked about the content of the iGEM competition,
                                                and also introduced the HUST-China team.</p>
                                            <p>Taking this as an opportunity, we introduced the team's projects in the
                                                past two years, led the students to review the conception process of our
                                                project, and shared our project creativity and some parts of the project
                                                design.</p>
                                            <p>After the lecture, we had a heated discussion with the students on the
                                                content just described.While answering questions, we also expressed the
                                                hope that these high school students who love biology can pay attention
                                                to synthetic biology and be able to apply it to real-world problems.</p>

                        <p>The university itself is a diversified learning platform, for our university students to
                            popularize science provides a lot of convenience. In the education of college students, we
                            rely on the institution of the school to show them synthetic biology and iGEM in a more
                            official and professional image. At the same time, we also attach importance to the training
                            of new team members. Since the beginning of this year, we have inherited the spirit and
                            tradition of iGEM predecessors, and cultivated a group of brand new iGEM team members. In
                            addition, we also actively publicized our humanistic practice overview and gains to the
                            public, so that more people could see how large-scale practical activities are
                            scientifically organized and carried out.</p>

                                                dyeing and perming. In the course, we provided hair dyeing experience
                                                activities. We provided hair and a variety of dyes for the students .
                                                Students could DIY their own hair color and styling, so as to have a

                        <p>This year, we innovatively launched online courses. With the current trend of online course
                            resource learning becoming stronger, we uploaded a series of online courses on the Bilibili
                            website, which are very popular among Chinese youth groups. The course content covers a wide
                            range, including not only a variety of basic theoretical knowledge, but also a full range of
                            application software teaching, aiming to train the audience to become a qualified iGEM
                            player through the course.</p>

                        <p>In July 2021, we participated in an education-aiding public welfare activity in Lianhua
                            Village, Pingxiang , Jiangxi Province for 21 days. An investigation about autism in Jiangxi
                            and several commonweal courses including bandhnu, popularization of synthetic biology, etc
                            were applied to students from Xiaoshui Village, Chetian Village, Shanxia Village and Lianhua
                            Village. During the popularization course, a vivid and lucid drama was used to reveal how
                            synthetic biology works and benefits the whole society. From the investigation, we found
                            that there was 29.8% of them suffering from severe autism, which was inextricably related to
                            relationship with parents and friends, while whether their parents were working outside of
                            town had no influence on them. To promote bandhnu and improve the autism and loneliness of
                            the students, we established a bandhnu course towards all grades and specialized one of
                            them. Colourful and various types of clothes, bags and scarves were created from them and
                            displayed in a T show during the farewell party. This public welfare activity expanded their
                            horizon, exposed them to professional knowledge and techniques, enhanced their confidence
                            and did deserve all our effort.</p>

                                                of them seemed to have slight or medium autism while another 29.8%
                                                suffering from severe autism. (see Fig1)</p>

                                                related to autism degree (P&lt;0.05) while having nothing to do with

                                                higher the score in autism test. Worse the relationship with parents,
                                                worse the autism.</p>

                                            <p>On the basis of project Mr. Tony, we established a bandhnu course of
                                                interest every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and a specialized one in
                                                Class one, Grade six. We bought pigment, enhancer, white T-shirts, hats
                                                and scarves. We explained the history of bandhnu and modern techniques,
                                                which could increase students' manipulative ability and creativity
                                                during application. In the farewell party at the end of the
                                                education-aiding course, T-show was held to encourage students daring to
                                                show off their product and personality. Through the charm of colour,
                                                students enhanced their relationship with each other and obviously,
                                                removed some of the lonliness.</p>

                        <p>With the invitation of the HZAU-China team, HUST-China travelled to Huazhong Agricultural
                            University to participate in the Bioethics Week. Both sides launched a friendship debate ---
                            ' artificial intelligence / humans are more likely to lead to human destruction '. After the
                            fierce debate between the two sides, the questioning of the audience, the comments of the
                            judges and the sharing of points of views, the audience had a new understanding of life
                            ethics. We do not want human civilization to really go to the day of destruction, but we
                            continue to imagine how it may be destroyed. So we should eliminate and avoid errors, and
                            then move forward more cautiously. It is beyond dispute that through this event, we can be
                            more cautious and also more courageous in the face of scientific progress and assume the
                            responsibility of life science practitioners.</p>

                        <p>In order to pay attention to the popularization and rapid development of synthetic biology,
                            HUST-China team responded to the call of CAU-China to join in voluntary lectures on
                            synthetic biology for all college students in Beijing community. This voluntary lecture,
                            faced with college students in Beijing, talked a lot about the history of synthetic biology,
                            basic knowledge of life science, brief introduction and prospect of synthetic biology, and
                            introduction of iGEM events, which not only expanded the influence of iGEM events, but also
                            comprehensively popularized synthetic biology. In addition, each team carried on the project
                            display in turn, really let the students combine with the actual application to consolidate
                            the basic knowledge of synthetic biology. We also arranged interesting knowledge answers and
                            questions part, which narrowed the gap between students, and comprehensively answered the
                            questions of students.</p>

                        <p>After the lecture, many listeners said that this event made them have some preliminary
                            understanding of the principles and applications of synthetic biology. The projects
                            introduced by the lecturers were very meaningful and promising, and they said that they
                            would continue to further understand and learn relevant knowledge in the future.</p>
