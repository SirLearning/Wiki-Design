                                            <p>Q: Our reductive peptides PepA, PepC and SPB for perming are short and we
                                                want to combine them into a chain because we are concerned that it is
                                                difficult to express them. Is this feasible and will it interfere with
                                                the effect of a single short peptide?</p>
                                            <p>A: Professor Feng believes that short peptides of that length can be
                                                expressed in extracellular successfully, they just can not be detected
                                                easily. He said that when not combining, they would more likely
                                                expression without being modified. On the other hand??that combined
                                                expressions may affect the nature of each unit. The uncertainty of
                                                heterogenous expression is high, and Professor Feng also encourages us
                                                to validate the conjecture in the experiments ourselves.</p>
                                            <p>After listening to Professor Feng's suggestion, we carried out a dry
                                                experiment to test different kinds of combination and selected the
                                                combination with the highest redox potential. Then we used that one to
                                                do our wet experiments.</p>

                        <p>Associate Professor Dabiao Liu is a professor of micro and nanomechanics in Huazhong
                            University of Science and Technology. When we first measured the mechanical properties of
                            hair, we used a tensometer in the laboratory, and found that our experimental method might
                            be problematic. Therefore, we visited Associate Professor Dabiao Liu who was engaged in
                            micro and nanomechanics measurement. He suggested that we use Young ' s modulus, stress
                            limit and tensile limit length as mechanical indexes to measure the degree of hair damage
                            after perming and dyeing. At the same time, he suggested that we use stress relaxation as a
                            mechanical index to measure the curling maintenance ability of hair after perming and
                            dyeing. He allowed us to borrow the micro-tensile / micro-torsional mechanical testing
                            instrument and three-dimensional depth of field microscope in his laboratory. Under the
                            guidance of his graduate students, we tested the mechanical properties of hair and obtained
                            quantitative experimental results.</p>

                                            <p>We met with Associate Professor Dabiao Liu in his laboratory after
                                                contacting him. We told him about our purpose of measuring the
                                                mechanical properties of hair before and after perming and dyeing, and
                                                described the methods we currently used and the unsatisfactory
                                                experimental results. He said the maximum tension obtained by hair was
                                                greatly influenced by hair diameter, so tension was not the best
                                                indicator to measure the mechanical properties of hair. Subsequently, he
                                                said that to understand the damage degree of hair after perming and
                                                dyeing, the essence was to explore the mechanical strength change of
                                                hair material after perming and dyeing. Therefore, on the basis of
                                                measuring the maximum tension, the Young's modulus and stress limit can
                                                be obtained by dividing the diameter of hair to obtain the mechanical
                                                strength of hair material. After we showed our hair samples, he said his
                                                lab had equipment to measure the parameters needed to calculate Young '
                                                s modulus. After several attempts, we determined that using Professor
                                                Liu ' s equipment to measure the Young ' s modulus / stress limit of
                                                hair is feasible.</p>
                                            <p>When it comes to measuring the curling maintenance ability of permed
                                                hair, he thought that we can solve this problem by measuring the stress
                                                relaxation of hair. He said that the hair could return to the original
                                                curl state after being subjected to a certain force. The essence was
                                                that the hair still had a certain elasticity, and it could return to the
                                                original state after elastic deformation under the force. When the force
                                                on the hair increases to a certain extent, the elastic deformation part
                                                of the hair decreases, the plastic deformation part increases, and the
                                                curl of the hair cannot be maintained. At this time, the hair will slide
                                                slowly along the external force, which can be used as a parameter to
                                                calculate the stress relaxation. The micro-tensile / micro-torsional
                                                mechanical testing instrument in Professor Liu ' s laboratory can
                                                measure stress relaxation. Then, with the help of Professor Liu ' s
                                                graduate students, we completed the processing of hair samples and the
                                                measurement of hair parameters.</p>

                        <p>Professor Maoteng Li is engaged in botany, genetics and other research. In vica-micronucleus
                            test we found that the micronucleus rate of indigo group was less than the negative control
                            group. Therefore, we consulted Professor Li Maoteng who studied botany. Professor Li
                            believed that the high concentration of solution may inhibit the division of cells in the
                            dividing zone, and the existing experimental results alone cannot explain the safety of
                            indigo. Therefore, we took Li teacher ' s proposal to experiment the lower concentration of
                            indigo dye, and got a more convincing conclusion.</p>

                                            <p>When we completed the analysis results of micronucleus test in
                                                vica-micronucleus test, we found that with the increase of
                                                concentration, the micronucleus first increased and then decreased, but
                                                the data in indigo group did not show this trend, and the micronucleus
                                                rates were lower than those in the negative control group. After
                                                reviewing our experimental results, Professor Li said that although the
                                                micronucleus rate of some groups was higher than the harmful standard,
                                                compared with the chemical hair dyes purchased on the market, our
                                                natural hair dyes had obviously lower micronucleus rate, indicating that
                                                our products had a great advantage in safety and recognized the
                                                practicability of our products. In view of our doubts about the indigo
                                                group data, Li said that combined with the experimental phenomenon that
                                                the micronucleus first increased and then decreased with the increase of
                                                concentration, it could be speculated that high concentration ( or high
                                                toxicity ) treatment may directly inhibit the division of root tip
                                                meristemac zone cells. When the number of divided cells decreases, the
                                                number of micronucleus that can be observed will naturally decrease. So
                                                the result that overall indigo group less than the negative control does
                                                not fully explain the safety of indigo. With the suggestion of Professor
                                                Li, we reduced the concentration of indigo. The results showed that the
                                                micronucleus rate of root tip treated with low concentration of indigo

                        <p>Associate Professor Tie Ke is engaged in genetic research. After we finished the
                            vica-micronucleus test, there were many questions about the analysis of experimental data
                            and the reliability of the conclusion. Therefore, we consulted Associate Professor Tie Ke
                            who studied genetics. Mr. Ke acknowledged our results, but also pointed out that abnormal
                            data of indigo group, suggested that we should further experiment. In addition, Professor Ke
                            was very interested in our developed algorithm for counting cell micronucleus, and expressed
                            his willingness to use this tool in the subsequent teaching of this experiment.</p>

                                            <p>Professor Tie Ke is not only a scholar in the field of genetics, but also
                                                undertakes the teaching work of genetics experiments. The
                                                vica-micronucleus test is one of his teaching contents, so he is more
                                                familiar with the content of this experiment. We gave him a detailed
                                                description of our experiments and showed our results. Professor Ke said
                                                that from the ratio of our positive control to negative control, our
                                                data were very reasonable, so the data of the experimental group also
                                                had credibility, and the significant difference between our dye paste
                                                and chemical dye paste could also explain the characteristics of our dye
                                                paste safety and health. At the same time, he also pointed out that the
                                                index of micronucleus of vicia faba root tips may be affected by many
                                                factors. The data with large deviation should not be discarded directly,
                                                but should be carefully analyzed and controlled as far as possible. With
                                                his suggestion, we carried out further experiments, explored more
                                                concentration gradients, and paid attention to controlling the
                                                consistency of the dissolution of the dye paste. More reasonable
                                                experimental data were obtained to prove the safety of our dye paste. In
                                                addition, in this experiment, each root tip needs to count at least 1000
                                                cells under the microscope to ensure the accuracy of the experimental
                                                results. Mr. Ke said it used to be manual counting, with heavy workload
                                                and uncontrollable errors. We use image recognition technology to
                                                develop a counting micronucleus algorithm, which greatly improves the
                                                experimental efficiency. Mr. Ke said he recognized our innovation, and
                                                is willing to promote this new method in the next experimental teaching,

                                            <p>We expect to connect short peptide PepACS with quantum dots to determine
                                                the absorption of short peptide by hair. It was found that connecting

                                                further affect the effect of perm and dye. Therefore, the PepACS after

                                            <p>We first explained the design idea of Mr. Tony project to Associate
                                                Professor Hu Jun, and proposed that short peptides were coupled with
                                                quantum dots by EDC / NHS method, and then the hair reacted with short
                                                peptides. Finally, the absorption of short peptides by hair was observed
                                                by fluorescence microscope. Associate Professor Hu pointed out that ( 1
                                                ) purification methods need to be considered after the completion of
                                                chemical coupling. It is suggested that ultrafiltration tube is more
                                                convenient. ( 2 ) Quantum dots are too large compared with short
                                                peptides with 42 amino acids, which may affect the function of short
                                                peptides. ( 3 ) The preparation method of quantum dots is too complex,
                                                which requires a long time for undergraduates to master. It is suggested
                                                that commercial quantum dots should be purchased directly for
                                                experiments.</p>
                                            <p>By communicating with Mr. Hu, the team eventually decided to use the
                                                common fluorescent molecule 5-carboxyfluorescein for experiments. The
                                                molecular weight of 5-carboxyfluorescein is small and does not affect
                                                the function of short peptides after coupling.</p>

                            also obtained the relevant experience of rapid expression of target proteins in the
                            laboratory. In addition, Dr Xiao Yi provides suggestions for the experimental design of our
                            pathway and heterologous yeast chassis expression.</p>

                        <p>The goal of our project is to produce a truly important product. We deeply realize that there
                            is a huge gap between theoretical experiments and industrial applications. In order to
                            shorten the difference between production, education and research as far as possible, we
                            strengthen the close ties with enterprises from the beginning of the project implementation
                            plan, and put their valuable opinions into the process of project progress.</p>

                        <p>Yantai Forestry Textile Printing and Dyeing Company Ltd is a private enterprise which
                            independently develops plant dyes to print and dye textiles. Its plant dye products also win
                            many awards. In order to understand the coloring of plant dyes and to explore better mordant
                            conditions, we visited Li Wei, the technical director of the company. The team members
                            learned that the company had made many important breakthrough scientific and technological
                            achievements in the field of plant dyes, understood the importance of the development of
                            science and technology to the emerging environmental protection industry, and also clarified
                            the major advantages of plant dyes in environmental protection. Director Li also provided
                            advice on the selection of our mordant. Finally, combined with their professional knowledge
                            and the technical experience of the company, the team members discussed about dye
                            development prospects. The company ' s manager also expressed confidence and expectations
                            for our project prospects and downstream applications.</p>

                        <p>Team leaders Changxin Fan and Jiacheng Shi interviewed Feiran Han, the technical director of
                            Lianchuan Biology, communicated with them about the understanding of synthetic biology and
                            our project design. Director Han pointed out that synthetic biology is now a rapidly
                            developing field. Synthetic biology can be used for research in the upper, middle and lower
                            reaches of biological fields such as basic research, technological development and
                            industrial application. Its core idea is the idea of design and redesign and engineering
                            systematization. With these thoughts, Director Han put forward his own opinions on our
                            project : our project conformed to the standardization of synthetic biology in the
                            construction process and it was also the embodiment of systematic thinking. But there was a
                            lack of some engineering ideas in it. He pointed out that on the one hand, we could
                            integrate multiple functions that we want to achieve; on the other hand, we could add logic
                            gates in it so that more functions could be achieved through regulation in a smaller system,
                            and it is easier to achieve quantitative regulation of each function. Based on the proposal
                            of Director Han, we integrate the two devices of dyeing and fading, and use two different
                            promoters to regulate them, so that the other part is closed when one part works.</p>

                        <p>Team leader Changxin Fan and Jiacheng Shi had a discussion with Feihu Xu, the head of Jiuyuan
                            Gene Development Department. Both of them discussed the characteristics of various chassis
                            for synthetic biology applications, especially for Pichia pastoris GS115. Director Xu has a
                            wealth of experience in heterologous expression using yeast as a chassis organism. He
                            pointed out that signal peptides played a very important role in heterologous extracellular
                            expression using the eukaryotic system, while signal peptides from different sources and
                            different structures are different. Some signal peptides may not secrete a certain protein,
                            but another signal peptide or protein can be synthesized and secreted in large quantities.
                            Eukaryotic system expression is a very complex process, the transformation, screening,
                            replication, transcription, translation, folding, transportation and other processes all
                            need to be considered and optimized. Based on the suggestions of Director Xu, we chose the
                            α-factor operon with commonly used signal peptide for extracellular expression, and the
                            operon without signal peptide for intracellular expression. All components were expressed in
                            both intracellular and extracellular ways and we should verify which expression is more
                            appropriate.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In the preliminary experiment of the project, we found that with temperature and other
                            conditions the coloring effect of chemical dyes and plant dyes fluctuated greatly. In order
                            to find a solution, iGEM HUST-China team members visited a private barbershop in Wuhan,
                            Hubei Province. During the conversation with the manager, we learned that in the practical
                            application process, hair dye does not act solely on hair, and the coloring effect itself is
                            closely related to temperature and oxidant content. The manager also recommended some
                            tentative plans for perming and dyeing hair. In addition, we have learned that the low
                            prevalence of plant hair dyes is mainly due to their relatively high prices and poor color
                            fixation effect. The barber 's manager also revealed expectations that technology could help
                            improve products.</p>
                        <h1>3 Our design</h1>
                        <p>After a series of visits and consultations, we finally confirmed Mr. Tony ' s overall project
                            plan combined with the suggestions of scientists and professors.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Tony project combines promoter, signal peptide, gene encoding protein, terminator and
                            other parts to form a device that can express a certain kind of protein, and then combines
                            functional related devices to form a system. We use molecular biology and microbiotechnology
                            to construct the system, which can express some enzymes to synthesize a kind of pigment or
                            short peptide to perm, and express other enzymes to degrade a kind of pigment or straighten
                            the hair. We then transfer the constructed three systems into three engineering yeasts using
                            Pichia pastoris GS115 as the chassis strain. Through this way, when glycerol is used as
                            carbon source, engineering yeast could express short peptides that can make hair curls and
                            enzymes that can synthesize pigments. These enzymes could synthesize three kinds of pigments
                            respectively with the added components in the system as substrates. When xylose is used as
                            carbon source, engineering yeast could express short peptides used to straighten hair and
                            enzymes that degrade pigments, using three pigments as substrates, respectively. After the
                            fermentation of engineering yeast, the pigments, decolorizing enzymes and short peptides are
                            separated and extracted. We carry out a series of experiments with the extracts to determine
                            the optimal working environment of the project and compare the advantages and disadvantages
                            of traditional chemical perm and dye and biological perm and dye in this project.</p>
