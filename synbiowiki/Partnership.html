As a team with 8 years of iGEM participating experience, we immediately reached a close partnership with this brand new team HUST2-China. Since it was the first time to participate in the competition, our brother team did not fully grasp the information about the competition process and regulations, so in the early stage of their team formation, HUST-China provided a lot of support to help them overcome difficulties. During the competition period of the past year, we have worked together to organize and participate in a number of online and offline activities. In the experimental stage, we exchange the progress and experience of the experiment at any time, and provide new ideas and plans for our respective experiments. We have a strong cooperative relationship with various projects outside the experiment, especially collaboration. Basically, meetings and activities in various regions can see the two teams of HUST appearing at the same time. We publicize unanimously externally and cooperate closely internally, and each of our final results contains the efforts and contributions of the other team.</p><h1>Support for the team building of HUST2-China</h1><p>During the project design phase, there is sufficient communication between the two teams. As a veteran team with iGEM experience, HUST-China provided assistance within its capacity for the construction of the HUST2-China team.</p><div class="modal-btn"><button class="btn btn-warning pull-right" data-target="#Partnership1" data-toggle="modal" type="button">Read More</button><div aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="Partnership1Label" class="modal fade" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false" id="Partnership1" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable modal-dialog-centered modal-xl"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title" id="Partnership1Label">Partnership1</h5></div><div class="modal-body"><p>We share our many years of experience in IGEM competition with HUST2-China, tell them the points for attention, and send team members to help them with knowledge and technology.In the conception stage, we have sent three team leaders to participate in the HUST2-China project design meeting many times to provide ideas for their experimental design. At the same time, we also take the experience of the past few years as an example to share how we designed, prepared and participated in iGEM in the past. We hope that the fraternal team can learn from our experience, use past achievements as an example, and avoid detours.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Sharing Experience" src="./statics/pics/Partnership/partnership-sharing_experience.png" style="width: 60%"/><p>Figure 1: Sharing Experience</p></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><button class="btn btn-danger" data-dismiss="modal" type="button">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><h1>Communication of project design</h1><p>HUST-China and HUST2-China are two teams from the same university, and this background provides great convenience for our communication. We had a lot of discussions early in the project design, and in the course of their respective project design, the two teams encountered similar problems, we interacted with each other in time, and eventually both teams found the ideal project solution.</p><div class="modal-btn"><button class="btn btn-warning pull-right" data-target="#Partnership2" data-toggle="modal" type="button">Read More</button><div aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="Partnership2Label" class="modal fade" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false" id="Partnership2" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable modal-dialog-centered modal-xl"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title" id="Partnership2Label">Partnership2</h5></div><div class="modal-body"><p>At the beginning of the project design, our two teams plan to produce related products based on the research results. Our projects are all based on the principles of people-oriented and healthy. We discussed in detail the ideas of business planning and product design, and finally determined the highlights and characteristics of each project, and completed the project with this as a starting point.</p><p>At the same time, the similarities between the two teams that used Escherichia coli as the chassis biological expression target to synthesize the final product also provided a lot of help for the communication. Our team was interested in the system used by HUST2-China to induce expressions through light and heat factors. This unique system was expected to be applied to our anabolic pathway: For the engineered bacteria that produce perm and hair dye, we can control the appropriate light and temperature to operate the expression of the engineered bacteria. However, in further communication, we learned about the specific parameters of the expression system. Considering the stability of our pigment products and the viability of the final product, we finally chose a chemical reagent-induced expression system.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button class="btn btn-danger" data-dismiss="modal" type="button">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><h1>Mutual assistance in modeling</h1><p>As a brother team, we should also share experience and help each other on modeling.

We helped them to establish an ion channel model to explore the transport of related ions and other substances on the cell membrane and the secretion of proteins.</p><div class="modal-btn"><button class="btn btn-warning pull-right" data-target="#Partnership3" data-toggle="modal" type="button">Read More</button><div aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="Partnership3Label" class="modal fade" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false" id="Partnership3" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable modal-dialog-centered modal-xl"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title" id="Partnership3Label">Partnership3</h5></div><div class="modal-body"><p>In the early stage of the experiment, the brothers expected to build a biochemical model as an experimental guide, but encountered difficulties in the specific implementation process. Coincidentally, the modeling students of our team have more systematic knowledge and more mature methods of building models. In order to verify the universality of this method and help our brother team, the modeling team members of our team discussed and cooperated with HUST2-China members, and helped them to establish an ion channel model to explore the transport of related ions and other substances on the cell membrane and the secretion of proteins. After this exchange, both sides have benefited a lot from it, and HUST2-China has also achieved the expected results, which is helpful to the direction of the experiment.</p><div class="image"><img alt="Model 1" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/T--HUST-China--img--partnership--partnership-help_HUST2_1.png" style="width: 60%"/><p>Figure 2: Model 1</p></div><div class="image"><img alt="Model 2" src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/3/35/T--HUST-China--img--partnership--partnership-help_HUST2_2.png" style="width: 60%"/><p>Figure 3: Model 2</p></div></div><div class="modal-footer"><button class="btn btn-danger" data-dismiss="modal" type="button">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><h1>Mutual cooperation about PV filming</h1><p>The 2021 iGEM competition requires two videos: promotion video and presentation video. During the production of these two videos, HUST2-China participated in the production of our videos. From the conception of the video content in the early stage to the shooting process to the final post-processing, HUST2-China has provided various help and support. Here we once again thank the brothers for the help with our promotional introduction and final summary videos.</p><h1>Mutual cooperation in the laboratory</h1><p>In the experimental stage, we also had a lot of cooperation and discussions with HUST2-China. We exchanged our own experimental ideas and methods, and at the same time learned the skills in the experiment.</p><div class="modal-btn"><button class="btn btn-warning pull-right" data-target="#Partnership4" data-toggle="modal" type="button">Read More</button><div aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="Partnership4Label" class="modal fade" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false" id="Partnership4" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable modal-dialog-centered modal-xl"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title" id="Partnership4Label">Partnership4</h5></div><div class="modal-body"><p>After constructing the gene expression pathway, we encountered difficulties in the extraction and purification of the protein: the extracted protein was either impurity or too high. Therefore, we discussed the extraction and purification of protein with our brother team. HUST2-China proposes a good method to extract and purify intracellular proteins using high pressure chromatography system. They have conducted many experiments on the method of high-pressure chromatography system to extract protein, and achieved good results, and they are relatively proficient in the application of this method, so our team learned from them the method of high-pressure chromatography system and applied it at the same time In our experiments, we have achieved ideal results and improved the quality of the extracted protein a lot.</p><p>At the same time, we also exchanged in other aspects, such as the operation of gel extraction and the transformation of E. coli and other experimental procedures. Both of teams have gained a lot in this process and encountered many problems. At the same time, the progress of the experiment has also been significantly improved.</p></div><div class="modal-footer"><button class="btn btn-danger" data-dismiss="modal" type="button">Close</button></div></div></div></div></div><h1>Meetings&amp; activities&amp; practices</h1><p>In all kinds of important meetings and events, our two teams always appear like twins. We jointly represented the Huazhong University of Science and Technology to participate in the HZAU&amp;HUST debate and friendly matches, communicate with the HAZU-China team, CCiC and other conferences and events. We collaborate and help each other in the communication process. In the organizational work, we learn from each other, absorb each other's good ideas and plans, and finally show a complete and powerful organizational image that can represent HUST.</p><div class="image"><img alt="The group photo of HUST1 and HUST2 " src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/5/5b/T--HUST-China--img--partnership--partnership-the_group_photo_of_HUST1_and_HUST2.png" style="width: 60%"/><p>Figure 4: The group photo of HUST1 and HUST2</p></div><div class="modal-btn"><button class="btn btn-warning pull-right" data-target="#Partnership5" data-toggle="modal" type="button">Read More</button><div aria-hidden="true" aria-labelledby="Partnership5Label" class="modal fade" data-backdrop="static" data-keyboard="false" id="Partnership5" tabindex="-1"><div class="modal-dialog modal-dialog-scrollable modal-dialog-centered modal-xl"><div class="modal-content"><div class="modal-header"><h5 class="modal-title" id="Partnership5Label">Partnership5</h5></div><div class="modal-body"><p>In the past year of cooperation, we have maintained close contact with HAZU.
