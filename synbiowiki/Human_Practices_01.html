                    <article>
                        <p>At present, perming and dyeing hair has become a trend and a new trend of beauty. However, in
                            China, the popularity of perming and dyeing is not as expected. Many people have the desire
                            to improve their image by perming and dyeing, but it has not been realized in the end. After
                            consulting the information, we found that there may be the following reasons: first of all,
                            the most common chemical hair dyes on the market will cause considerable harm to the human
                            body; secondly, the domestic public may have a certain degree of prejudice against the
                            exaggerated styling; in addition, the potential value of the plant hair dye market is great,
                            but the market share is very low.</p>
                        <p>In order to solve the problems above, our team decided to develop a healthy, humanized and
                            reversible integrated ironing and dyeing product. While solving the problems, the plant dyes
                            we choose have also achieved an environmentally friendly breakthrough and contributed to the
                            world's environmental protection.</p>
                        <p>In order to confirm our cause analysis and extensively investigate the opinions of the
                            public, we have conducted extensive surveys on people of different identities, consumers,
                            entrepreneurs and relevant stakeholders by means of interviews, questionnaires and so on.
                        </p>

                            people's attitudes towards perming and dyeing, we selected a number of people of different
                            ages and occupations to conduct interviews</p>

                        <p>Chemical dyes do great harm to our hair, but nowadays many college students know the harm,
                            but still choose to dye their hair. Today, college students seem to have become the main
                            consumer group in the hair dyeing market. For this reason, we interviewed several college
                            students. Through our interviews and investigations, we found that most college students are
                            very aware of the harm caused by hair dyeing, and they are also very worried about it. After
                            the interview, we found that some people who use chemical dyes to dye their hair more or
                            less have hair health problems, such as poorer hair quality, hair bifurcations and so on.
                            Frequent use of chemical dyes leads to the deterioration of hair quality. The sequelae of
                            appearance reduction such as hair loss, hair loss and bifurcation are the main reasons for
                            college students to give up dyeing their hair. Most students who have dyed their hair or
                            want to dye their hair say they will choose not to dye their hair if the dye makes their
                            hair worse. For natural plant hair dyeing products, most students are very willing to try
                            and accept, but a small number of students say that they doubt whether natural pigment hair
                            dyeing can have the advantages of various color selectivity and high color fastness like
                            chemical reagents. Some students said that the price of natural plant hair dyeing product is
                            also the prime consideration of their choice of dye. College students who do not have a
                            fixed income may have no choice but to choose relatively cheap chemical dyes.</p>

                                            <p>Interviewees: three college students from Huazhong University of Science
                                                and Technology</p>
                                            <p>Detailed interview notes are as follows:</p>
                                            <p>Interviewee A:girl with her hair dyed</p>
                                            <p>Q:How long have you dyed your hair? And how many times have you dyed your
                                                hair?</p>
                                            <p>A:It has been dyed for a while, about a month or so. This is the fourth
                                                time I have dyed my hair.</p>
                                            <p>Q:The fourth time to dye your hair, it should be regarded as more
                                                relative to dyeing your hair, so what aspects do you value in your
                                                choice of hair dye all the time? Are there any requirements for the
                                                choice of hair dye?</p>
                                            <p>A:What I value more is the raw material of hair dye. I generally prefer
                                                the one that does the least harm to my hair. Because I personally like
                                                to dye my hair, I want to try any kind of color. If the hair dye does
                                                too much harm to my hair, my hair health can not support my desire to
                                                dye all kinds of colors.</p>
                                            <p>Q:May I ask whether your hair dye is chemical dye or natural dye?</p>
                                            <p>A:Chemical dye. I am just worried that the natural dye will be dyed black
                                                like Polygonum multiform, and the color richness may not be as much as
                                                that of chemical dye.</p>
                                            <p>Q:Oh, so if there is a "natural dye hair dye" product on the market, and
                                                there are many colors to choose from, would you want to try it?</p>
                                            <p>A:If the price is also pleasant, it would be great, and it would be a
                                                boon for those of us who are addicted to dyeing our hair.</p>
                                            <p>Interviewee B:girl with black hair</p>
                                            <p>Q:Have you ever dyed your hair? Or do you want to dye your hair?</p>
                                            <p>A:I haven't dyed it. I actually want to dye my hair a little bit.</p>
                                            <p>Q: Oh, so what is the reason why you didn't dye your hair?</p>
                                            <p>A: because my hair has not been very good and dry since I was a child,
                                                and it has a little bifurcation. I'm worried that dyeing my hair will
                                                make it worse for my unhealthy hair.</p>
                                            <p>Q: if hair dye is made from natural pigment, would you like to try it?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>A: yes, I would. Would you like to add chemicals if you dye your hair
                                                with natural pigments?</p>
                                            <p>Q: the dye produced by our project does not add chemicals, and it also
                                                has a good effect on hair dyeing.</p>
                                            <p>A: in that case, I'm more than willing to try.</p>
                                            <p>Interviewee C:girl with black hair</p>
                                            <p>Q: Hi, have you ever dyed your hair?</p>
                                            <p>A: dyed it. But it was a long time ago.</p>
                                            <p>Q: then why don't you dye it now?</p>
                                            <p>A: last time I dyed and bleached my hair, which damaged the quality of my
                                                hair a lot and broke a lot of hair. After that, I never dared to try to
                                                dye my hair again.</p>
                                            <p>Q: did you choose the chemical dye for your hair last time?</p>
                                            <p>A: yes, the barber recommended it, but I think it does too much harm to
                                                the hair.</p>
                                            <p>Q: what do you think of natural hair dyeing products? Have you ever
                                                considered using this kind of product to dye your hair?</p>
                                            <p>A: yes, but the price of this kind of product in the barber shop is
                                                really a little high for me as a student, so I am prohibitive. Hair
                                                dyeing is not necessary, it's just a decoration.</p>
                                            <p>Q: what if there is a hair dye product with friendly price, green raw
                                                material and good effect? Do you have the idea to try?</p>
                                            <p>A: if there is such a product, I would want to dye my hair again. As I
                                                just said, hair dyeing is a decoration, although hair dyeing is
                                                optional, but if you dye it to make yourself look good, why not do it?
                                            </p>

                        <h3>Elderly people</h3>
                        <p>In order to investigate the views of different age groups on hair dyeing and hair care, we
                            interviewed the middle-aged and elderly people by means of online video. Through our
                            interview, we found that more and more middle-aged and elderly people choose to dye their
                            hair because of the increase in gray hair. Most people say that they are very supportive of
                            hair dyeing, which can cover their silver hair and make a person more energetic in
                            appearance, and their mentality will become younger when they see themselves younger. Many
                            people say this is an act of killing two birds with one stone. Through our survey, we also
                            found that people today are under great social pressure and a fast pace of life, resulting
                            in a continuous decline in the age of silver-haired people, and many middle-aged people in
                            their forties and fifties (not really old age) also have a lot of gray hair. This group is
                            also one of the main consumers in the hair dyeing market. Compared with college students,
                            this kind of hair dye consumers are different in their higher consumption and more pursuit
                            of quality and raw materials. For them, the safety and health of dyes are more important.
                            Many people choose dyes with advertising words such as "traditional Chinese medicine",
                            "natural" and "health". They value health more than a variety of colors and cheap prices.
                            Therefore, we believe that middle-aged and elderly group will be the main consumers of
                            natural dyes.</p>

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Q: what do you think of hair dyeing? Do you want to dye it black when you
                                                have gray hair?</p>
                                            <p>A: I kind of want to dye my hair. Now that white hair grows out, it shows
                                                that people are old, and people with dyed hair look younger and look
                                                better.</p>
                                            <p>Q: so what kind of hair dyeing products will you choose if you dye your
                                                hair later?</p>
                                            <p>A: I see the kind of traditional Chinese medicine dye hair in the
                                                advertisement, which attracts me very much.</p>
                                            <p>Q: that's natural dyes. What do you think of chemical dyes?</p>
                                            <p>A: I always feel that chemical dyes are bad for our health. That hair is
                                                attached to the scalp. It would be bad if some chemical seeps into the
                                                body from the scalp and does any harm to the body. We are old now, and
                                                we are not as good as we used to be. We dare not use it
                                                indiscriminately.</p>
                                            <p>Interviewee E:A dark-haired aunt around 60</p>
                                            <p>Q: Hello, auntie. Your bright black hair is very beautiful. I'd like to
                                                interview you about how to take care of your hair every day.</p>
                                            <p>A: I dyed my hair at home. I'm old now. My hair is gray a lot. I look
                                                young when I dye my hair, and I'm in better spirits.</p>
                                            <p>Q: Oh, what kind of hair dye do you choose to dye your own hair?</p>
                                            <p>A: I saw a traditional Chinese medicine hair dye on TV. It advertised
                                                that traditional Chinese medicine hair dye would not hurt my health. I
                                                bought it to try it.</p>
                                            <p>Q: so you chose this product because its slogan is "traditional Chinese
                                                medicine" and "it doesn't hurt your body"?</p>
                                            <p>A: that's right. We all know traditional Chinese medicine. Recuperating
                                                the body will definitely do much less harm to the scalp.</p>

                        <h2>1.2 Social Attitude</h2>
                        <p>In addition to the health effects of dye reagents, the public's attitude towards hair dyeing
                            is also an important factor restricting the freedom to perm and dye hair. In China,
                            especially among the older generation, perming and dyeing hair, especially those with
                            exaggerated shapes and colors, are often regarded as informal or too lively. Considering the
                            universal practicality of the product, we investigated the attitudes of different classes
                            towards hair dyeing. The overall survey results show that most people are not resistant to
                            hair dyeing, and many people say they want to try. The main problem is that if you want to
                            dye your hair, you need to dye it back, which not only do harms the quality of your hair,
                            but also makes it more troublesome. Therefore, we imagine that the "fade" function will be
                            added to the project, and the color can be faded by using other substances after dyeing the
                            hair.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>For individuals, dyeing hair shows personality, represents avantgarde and their attention
                            towards appearance. But for employees at work, they may be tied up in order to maintain
                            their appearance at a critical moment. For companies, employees should be loyal to their
                            work when they are at work. If there are more such employees, it will increase unnecessary
                            economic and time costs for the company. The boss said that enterprises need to have
                            enterprise culture, regulations, and some restrictions. Company needs to regulate employees'
                            behavior and appearance during work in order to maintain the image of the company. At the
                            same time, the boss also said that apart from working hours, the company has no objection
                            but respect all ideas of employees to manage their appearance and publicize their
                            personality. When interviewing employees, we come to the conclusion that although most
                            people have the desire to dye their hair, it is inconvenient or troublesome for them to go
                            to work. Although the company does not restrict the behavior of individuals during their
                            non-working hours, dyeing their hair after work and back to work for a day or two is both
                            time-consuming, and it will do more harm than good for people who work in society. The
                            person in charge said that he very supports the idea that employees have such an idea to
                            dress themselves up. Employees do what they want to do without violating the company rules,
                            and keeping a happy mood is also a guarantee for the boss</p>

                                                have any suggestions or ideas on the concept of designing hair dyeing
                                                products?</p>
                                            <p>A: according to our company's policy, you can't dye that bright color
                                                during working hours. Of course, black and brown are allowed. In view of
                                                the nature of some positions, such as customer service, public
                                                relations, outreach and other positions that need to represent the image
                                                of the company, the company is not allowed to dye hair. Employees go out
                                                to work, represents the image of the company, dyed a variety of hair,
                                                inevitably will not make customers feel a little immature, do not rest
                                                assured to leave the project to us to do. But after work time, we have

                                                they want to do, dye the color they want. If there is a product that can
                                                be dyed and faded at any time, it should be able to solve this big
                                                problem.</p>
                                            <p>Q: (ask employees) what do you think of the company's regulations on hair
                                                dyeing? will hair dyeing really give up for salaried people like you
                                                because of trouble?</p>
                                            <p>A: I don't think there's anything wrong with this rule. Too conspicuous
                                                hair color will not only disturb the attention of me and my colleagues,
                                                but may also make a bad impression on customers when they go out to meet
                                                customers. Although it can be dyed after work, it is really troublesome
                                                for us. I am very tired at the end of the day. It will take me a few
                                                hours to dye my hair for two days. It's going to be dyed back on Sunday
                                                night. Even if I'm not tired, the hair dye on the market is uneven, and
                                                my hair can't stand it.</p>

                        <p>We interviewed a student and his counselor teacher from Huazhong University of Science and
                            Technology. The feedback is that the teacher has no objection to hair dyeing. However, he
                            believes that when a student is still a student at school, his main mind should be on study.
                            There is still a lot of opposition to hair dyeing during class. Holidays, winter and summer
                            holidays, such holiday time, students can do whatever he likes, including hair dyeing and
                            perming. Students dye and perm their hair is their own choice, if he can feel happy from it,
                            the external improvement will also increase self-confidence. For the students, we
                            interviewed him separately and learned that his idea was similar to that of the counselor.
                            When he's at school, he focuses on his studies and doesn't care about it at all. In
                            addition, too conspicuous hair color, also reflects the individual personality publicity,
                            may attract more attention, but the student's personality is quiet, he chose to give up hair
                            color to maintain his serenity. May be during the holiday, a whim will want to try some new
                            hair color, change the mental outlook. As a result, we are more certain that the market
                            acceptance level of the "fading" design will be very high.</p>

                                                personality is not so obvious that I don't want to be too conspicuous at
                                                school. Secondly, I think it is feasible to dye your hair on holiday
                                                weekends if you can give priority to study at school. If there is such a
                                                product, it is really convenient for me to dye it after school and fade
                                                it at the beginning of school.</p>

                        <h3>Family.</h3>
                        <p>We came to the houses of several students and had an in-depth understanding of what parents
                            think of hair dyeing. A small number of parents said that they could not accept their
                            children to dye their hair because they would think that their children were not paying
                            attention to their studies. But most parents show respect for their children's choice to dye
                            their hair. They say that times are changing, external changes will not affect internal
                            changes, hair dyeing is only a way to pursue fashion personality, they do not want their
                            children to leave regrets on the way to grow up. After investigation, we found that most
                            parents have something in common, that is, children are required not to dye their hair
                            during school. Other parents say that hair dyeing is more harmful to their hair and do not
                            want their children to try. However, after learning about our faded product concept, they
                            expressed their interest. Such healthy and convenient products can not only allay the
                            worries of parents, but also satisfy the will of children to show personality and pursue
                            themselves.</p>

                                            <p>Parent A: I don't agree with children dyeing their hair. Hair dyeing is
                                                not only harmful to the hair. And she is still a student, too flamboyant
                                                color that is not good-looking has an impact on learning.</p>
                                            <p>Parent B: I have no objection to her child dyeing her hair. She can do
                                                whatever she wants. It's just that everything needs to be based on the
                                                fact that the school is not allowed to dye hair while in school, so hair
                                                dyeing is not allowed in school. But during the holidays and weekends,
                                                she can do what she wants.</p>
                                            <p>Parent C: I have no objection. Now that the child is an adult, it is his
                                                freedom to do what he wants. But I learned that hair dyeing is both
                                                troublesome and unhealthy, and I'm still worried. The product you just
                                                mentioned, natural pigment hair dye, can also be faded, this design
                                                concept is very good. I think many parents will also support it.</p>

                            without people. Hair perming and dyeing had been a trend of the world since 4000 B.C..
                            Nowadays, though we could see a blooming hairdressing market of over $380 billion, glance
                            into the deep-seated requirement of the market is needed. To have a clearer sight of this,
                            we initiate a public survey about perming and dyeing and our idea of them.</p>

                                            <p>For the start, we would like to figure out whether the informants had
                                                experience of perming and dyeing-and why. As a result, we find out that
                                                about 70% of them had experience of perming and 60% who comes to dyeing.
                                                For those who have the experience of perming, potion perm (92.13%) is
                                                far more famous than heated roller ones (18.45%). For those who have the

                                                still see more 'chemistry' than 'biology' here. When hairdressing
                                                measures were born, seldom did people care about what these chemicals
                                                had done to people's outer 'organs'of the hair. It is true that whatever
                                                used on our hair doesn't participate in our metabolism, but they will
                                                eventually touch the scalp, which seems inevitable whatsoever.</p>

                                                any attention to the toxic side effects and 15% of the rest consider all
                                                the perming and dyeing as harmless. But for the majority, people do know
                                                some of the danger lying under the peace. From all these, the conclusion
                                                is clear. With all the awareness of all this and that, people still

                        <h2>3.1 Hair Salon</h2>
                        <p>In recent years, consumers' awareness of "green health" is getting stronger and stronger. In
                            barber shops, people are more inclined to healthy and harmless green products than chemical
                            ironing agents that do great damage to their hair. However, in China, the upstream of plant
                            perming and dyeing industry is mainly the extraction of various colored plant components,
                            dye processing equipment, etc. in the process of plant dye production, the problem of long
                            consumption cycle, large input of manpower and material resources and low extraction
                            efficiency cannot be solved well. In the downstream of plant dye industry (like dyeing
                            barbershop), plant dyes are difficult to fix and fast to decolorize. High cost also
                            discourages domestic barbershop from using plant hair dyes. Therefore, with the
                            diversification of market consumption and the need for the pursuit of health, the
                            traditional plant perming and dyeing process needs to absorb modern scientific knowledge and
                            use materialization methods, so as to develop into high-tech fields, improve and enhance its
                            own application value. Mr. Tony needs to grasp this trend, to use microbial fermentation to
                            overcome the problem of low extraction efficiency of components in the traditional industry,
                            and to reduce the production manpower, material resources and time cost, also explore the
                            best coloring conditions of each dye by carrying out relevant experiments. It is also
                            necessary to evaluate the ability of natural dyes to adhere to hair and the effect of
                            natural dyes on hair properties. Pay attention to the decolorization time of dyes while
                            improving color fixation. In the part of hair dyeing, we need to select the perm agent which
                            can easily enter the hair cortex on the basis of the traditional perm principle, so as to
                            meet people's perm requirements healthily without harming the quality of the hair.</p>

                                            <p>In an interview with the barber's owner, we learned that the perming and
                                                dyeing shop had innovated the perm &amp; dye substance. There are mostly
                                                chemical perm dyes on the market, which do great damage to the hair. So
                                                they aim at the plant hair dye, which is a new type of dye. Because
                                                there are no harmful chemicals that do great damage to the hair, it can
                                                greatly reduce the hair damage caused by perm dyeing. And on the whole,
                                                the trend of using plant dyes is increasing day by day. After people's
                                                material foundation is satisfied, consumers gradually pursue a healthier
                                                life, so they are full of confidence in plant hair dyeing. It is
                                                believed that the demand for plant hair dyes will continue to increase
                                                in the future, but at present, the cost of plant hair dyeing is
                                                generally high and the dyeing effect isn't excellent. Therefore, our Mr.

                                            <p>After communicating with another owner of the barber shop, we learned
                                                that in the upstream of the dye industry, relevant approval of sewage
                                                disposal needs to be strictly in accordance with the national standards.
                                                The government has different requirements for different enterprises.
                                                Each production enterprise needs emission permit and has strict limits
                                                on the pollution factors in the discharge. And now the dye companies on
                                                the market have to pass the test and be allowed to discharge pollution
                                                after being qualified. At the same time, the production of raw materials
                                                must be in accordance with the standards and indicators issued by the
                                                state. In the downstream of the industry, enterprises who need or use
                                                dye will not be excessively investigated dye raw materials are natural
                                                or chemical in the premise of qualified indicators. However, it is found
                                                that consumers' awareness of "green and health" is becoming stronger and
                                                stronger, and they are more inclined to healthy and harmless green
                                                products. Green dye, dye with Chinese medicine, which show small harm to
                                                body and healthier, are more popular among consumers. In this condition,
                                                Mr. Tony need to solve the problem at the starting point, holding

                        <h2>3.2 Environmental Protection Agency / Company</h2>
                        <p>In daily life, textile printing and dyeing industry is one of the industries with the
                            greatest degree of environmental pollution. The existing dyeing technology is mainly based
                            on chemical dyes, which will bring pollution of air, water and solid wastes. Pollutants such
                            as NPE and aromatic carcinogens can cause irreversible damage to human body and surrounding
                            environment. In the long run there will be huge economic losses. In recent years, chemical
                            dyes have gradually retreated, and plant hair dyes have emerged. Using plant dyes to dye
                            hair will not only minimize the harm to human body, but also zero pollution to the
                            environment due to the source of biological materials. However, because of various problems
                            of natural dyes, it is difficult to open the market. Mr. Tony adopts microbial fermentation,
                            which not only needs to avoid various problems in the production of plant dyes, but also
                            provides new methods for the production of traditional plant dyes. In addition, in the
                            fermentation process, the precursors and intermediate products of dyes we adopt should be
                            environmentally friendly with few by-products and meet the needs of environmental
                            protection. Based on biological science, we need to produces products eco-friendly and meet
                            the needs of the public. At the same time, in order to avoid the overflow of engineering
                            bacteria in the environment, we need to adopt strict sterilization in the production
                            process, optimize the fermentation process, not only reduce the probability of contamination
                            of miscellaneous bacteria in the fermentation process, but also eliminate the possibility of
                            biological contamination caused by the overflow of engineering bacteria into the
                            environment.</p>

                                                according to drawings, contracting orders by himself, designing sewage
                                                treatment equipment from scratch and realizing it. In the course of the
                                                interview, we learned about the principle and effect of the sewage

                                                understood the internal structure of all kinds of equipment. We also
                                                deeply realized steps that sewage needs to go through from seriously
                                                exceeding the standard of pollutants to being able to discharge safely.
                                                Through this interview, we have a deeper understanding of dye pollution
                                                treatment. And the relevant indicators for dealing with dye pollution in

                                                the principle that it is harmless to the human body and good to the
                                                environment in the production process. From the input of raw materials
                                                to the acquisition of the final product to the use of the product, the
                                                intermediate products need to be harmless to the environment and there
                                                are few by-products as far as possible, so as to meet the needs of
                                                environmental protection. After communicating with engineer Wang Yong,

                                                enterprises are complex and difficult to deal with. Therefore, high
                                                pollution enterprises like these can not completely rely on follow-up
                                                sewage treatment. In order to solve the problem of high pollution, we
                                                must start from the source. Therefore, we need a very good dye product
                                                that avoids pollution from the production process. It is also to cater
                                                to the trend of pollution control around the world in the future, and
                                                really achieve the integration of enterprise production and

                                                learned that the biggest difficulty in the current supervision of the
                                                Environmental Protection Bureau lies in the irregular emission of waste

                                                and realized the potential advantages of Mr.Tony in producing natural

                        <p>Tie-dyeing set off a fashion craze because of its gorgeous and simple design. However, due to
                            the promulgation of the national policy on environmental protection, the tie-dyeing industry
                            is becoming extinct, and because of the serious aging of the employees, the tie-dyeing
                            technology has the risk of losing generations. At the same time, the key point of tie-dyeing
                            technology is to use plants for dyeing, but in the production process of tie-dyeing, plant
                            dyes have low productivity, raw materials are more expensive and rare, which makes more
                            convenient and fast chemical dyeing to replace plant dyeing in a large area. Mr.Tony was
                            born in the laboratory. In order to synthesize natural dyes by engineering yeast, it is
                            necessary to solve the problems of complex preparation process and low purity of dyes in the
                            traditional tie-dyeing process, so as to realize the mass production of natural dyes. In the
                            follow-up, the team needs to explore the optimal dyeing conditions and color mixing
                            experiments of the dyes, so as to provide the possibility for showing a variety of colors in
                            the tie-dyeing process. At the same time, it is also very important to realize the
                            quantitative analysis of plant dyes and clarify the chemical composition, optimal dosage and
                            biochemical principles of dyes and auxiliaries in the dyeing process through experiments. so
                            as to help tie-dyeing, a traditional handicraft industry on a large scale. Let the
                            tie-dyeing process which strongly depends on traditional dyes go further and grow stronger.

                                            <p>At the Puzhen tie-dyeing Museum, there are a number of dyed fabrics
                                                waiting to be oxidized and dried on the outside, most of them have a
                                                large area and exquisite designs, and then we can see that several large
                                                dye vats are filled with dyes, emitting a special aroma. There are many
                                                mounted handicrafts in the dyeing workshop, with a variety of
                                                craftsmanship, styles and categories, with ulterior motives in the
                                                placement arrangement. At the same time, even the ceiling of the
                                                tie-dyeing workshop is covered with dye cloth. Being in the dyeing
                                                workshop and looking around, the line of sight is full of blue and white
                                                patterns, making people feel the strong atmosphere of tradition and
                                                folklore. However, the incompatibility between natural
                                                dyeing&amp;traditional processes and large-scale production also
                                                appears, especailly in small workshops, while the productivity of plant
                                                dyes is low, and raw materials are more expensive and rarer, so plant
                                                dyeing shows great deficiencies compared with more convenient and rapid
                                                chemical dyeing, so Mr.Tony is needed to solve the problems of complex
                                                dye preparation process and low purity of dyes used in traditional
                                                tie-dyeing process, so as to achieve mass production of natural dyes, to
                                                help more craftsmen to achieve large-scale, better promotion of
                                                traditional technology.</p>

                                            <p>In the Dali Lanxu tie-dyeing experience Museum, we learned that the
                                                tie-dyeing process is divided into two processes: tying and dyeing. The
                                                technique of tying determines the trend and basic shape of the pattern.
                                                Complex and exquisite patterns often need to be embroidered with basic
                                                pattern units in advance, which is similar to the principle of cutting
                                                window grilles, showing the final pattern symmetrically, and then in
                                                interviews with staff and follow-up visits, we deeply understand that
                                                traditional and natural as the keyword of this old craft, have been paid
                                                more and more attention by the society in recent years, and also meet
                                                the consumption needs of people in the new era. However, the failure of
                                                natural dyeing and traditional technology to achieve large-scale
                                                production is still a huge problem faced by the traditional process, and
                                                it is precisely because of this that the main production mode of the
                                                traditional handicraft industry is still small-scale operation, and
                                                heavily relies on tourism and other industries. In addition to producing
                                                dyes, our team also needs to explore the optimal dyeing conditions and
                                                color mixing experiments in order to provide the possibility of showing
                                                a variety of colors in the tie-dyeing process and mass production. At
                                                the same time, it is necessary to realize the quantitative analysis of
                                                plant dyes, clarify the chemical composition of dyes and dyeing aids in
                                                the dyeing process, the optimal dosage and the biochemical principles in
                                                the dyeing process, so as to provide solutions to the traditional
